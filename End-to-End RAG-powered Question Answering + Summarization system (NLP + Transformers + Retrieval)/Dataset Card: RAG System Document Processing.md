# Dataset Card: RAG System Document Processing

## Dataset Summary

This document describes the data processing pipeline and requirements for the RAG Question-Answering System. The system is designed to work with user-uploaded documents rather than a fixed dataset.

## Supported Data Formats

### Input Formats
- **PDF Files (.pdf)**
  - Text extraction using pdfplumber and pypdf
  - Handles multi-page documents
  - Preserves basic document structure

- **Text Files (.txt)**
  - Plain text documents
  - UTF-8 and Latin-1 encoding support
  - Preserves line breaks and formatting

- **Markdown Files (.md)**
  - Markdown-formatted documents
  - Preserves structure and formatting
  - Suitable for technical documentation

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Document Ingestion**
   - File validation and format detection
   - Text extraction with error handling
   - Metadata collection (filename, size, type)

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Whitespace normalization
   - Removal of null and replacement characters
   - Encoding standardization

3. **Text Chunking**
   - Semantic chunking with configurable size (default: 512 characters)
   - Overlapping chunks (default: 128 characters overlap)
   - Sentence and paragraph boundary preservation
   - Chunk metadata tracking (position, source document)

4. **Embedding Generation**
   - Vector representation using sentence-transformers
   - Batch processing for efficiency
   - Normalization for cosine similarity

5. **Index Creation**
   - FAISS vector index construction
   - Metadata storage and mapping
   - Persistent storage for reuse

## Data Quality Considerations

### Input Requirements
- Documents should be primarily text-based
- Clear, readable text for optimal performance
- Reasonable document length (recommended: < 10MB per file)
- Structured content performs better than unformatted text

### Preprocessing Limitations
- Complex layouts may lose formatting
- Tables and figures are converted to text
- Non-text elements (images, charts) are ignored
- OCR is not performed on scanned documents

## Privacy and Compliance

### Data Handling
- Documents are processed locally within the system
- No external API calls for document processing
- Temporary files are cleaned up after processing
- Vector embeddings are stored locally

### User Responsibilities
- Users must ensure they have rights to upload documents
- Sensitive or confidential documents should be handled with appropriate security measures
- Users are responsible for compliance with relevant data protection regulations

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability
- Tested with document collections up to 1000 files
- Processing time scales linearly with document size
- Memory usage depends on collection size and chunk count

### Quality Factors
- Clean, well-structured documents yield better results
- Domain-specific terminology may require larger context
- Document diversity improves system robustness

## Example Usage

### Suitable Document Types
- Technical documentation
- Research papers and articles
- Knowledge base articles
- Policy documents
- Educational materials
- FAQ collections

### Recommended Practices
- Upload related documents together for better context
- Use descriptive filenames for better source attribution
- Ensure documents are in supported languages (primarily English)
- Test with a small subset before processing large collections

## Evaluation and Metrics

### Document Processing Metrics
- **Processing Speed:** Documents per minute
- **Chunk Quality:** Semantic coherence of generated chunks
- **Retrieval Coverage:** Percentage of document content accessible through search

### Quality Indicators
- Successful text extraction rate
- Chunk boundary quality (sentence/paragraph preservation)
- Embedding generation success rate

## Known Limitations

### Format Limitations
- Complex PDF layouts may not extract cleanly
- Password-protected files are not supported
- Very large files (>50MB) may cause memory issues
- Non-Latin scripts may have reduced performance

### Content Limitations
- Mathematical formulas may not be preserved
- Code snippets in documents may lose formatting
- References and citations may be fragmented across chunks

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
- Support for additional file formats (DOCX, HTML)
- Improved table and list handling
- Better preservation of document structure
- OCR support for scanned documents

### Optimization Opportunities
- Adaptive chunking based on document structure
- Domain-specific preprocessing pipelines
- Improved metadata extraction and preservation
